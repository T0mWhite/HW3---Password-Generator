# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Created a random password generator which generates a password between 8-128 characters based on user selection.

Decided that using checkboxes was much more user friendly than prompts, which gave way to it's own host of new challenges.

Script 2 is the working final script. I split them during a bit of experiementation but left script.js to show the changes before refactoring and heavy polishing.
